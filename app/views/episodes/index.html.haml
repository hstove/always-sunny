        The above chart plots the different day of the week and time of day that every
        %em 'Always Sunny'
        episode starts. Every episode begins by stating
        the current time and day of week. It looks like this:

          an inspiration

        It should be implied that I am a mega-fan of
        %em Always Sunny.
        As part of my fandom, I've been curious about the distribution of when these episodes
        start, and if there are any patterns. I've wanted to plot them like the
        'punchcard' graph on Github does.

      %p
        So, I went ahead and made it, and you can see the result up top.
        Click and drag on the chart to zoom in. Episodes that start at the same
        time as others get stacked on top of each other.

      %p
        Most episodes seem to start in the middle of the day on a weekday. They often
        start as a typical 'day in the life' of the gang, then something happens and the
        plot gets going.

      - days = @episodes.group_by {|e| e.starts_at.strftime('%A') }
      .table-wrapper
        %table
          %thead
            %tr
              %th
              %th # of Episodes
              %th Average Time
          %tbody
            - %w{Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday}.each do |day|
              %tr
                %td.text= day
                %td= days[day].count
                - average_date = days[day].map {|e| e.starts_at.to_i }.inject(:+) / days[day].size
                %td= Time.at(average_date).to_datetime.utc.strftime('%l:%M %P')

      %p
        Interestingly, the most common day is Monday, and it gets less common until the weekend hits.
        From a plot device perspective, I find this intriguing, as Monday and the beginning of the
        weekend seem like two good times to start a story.

        Only one episode starts on Sunday. Appropriately, it begins with Mac confessing
        to a priest in
        = succeed "." do
          %em How Mac Got Fat
        The next-closest thing is another Mac-themed episode,
        = succeed "," do
          %em Mac Day
        which starts at 11:55pm on a Saturday night, just in time to start
        Mac Day on a Sunday.

          %em "We're gonna go America all over their asses."
        The latest beginning of an episode is 2:30 am on a Friday night (Saturday morning), the beginning of
        = succeed "." do
          %em Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody's Ass
        The gang is cleaning up after closing the bar and shooting the shit.
        Dennis pisses off Charlie by blowing smoke in his face, which he
        believes is within his constitutional rights.

      %p
        The earliest start to an episode is in
        = succeed "," do
          %em Dennis Gets Divorced
        as Dennis is trying to sneak away from a snoring Maureen Ponderosa.

      %p
        There are three episodes that don't follow the pattern of telling you what time
        and day it is. Two of them are Part 2's (
        %em The Gange Gets Whacked: Part 2
        and
        %em Mac & Charlie Die: Part 2
        ).
        The other one is
        = succeed "," do
          %em The Gang Makes Lethal Weapon 6
        which starts right out with Chief Lazarus being brought back to life.

      %p
        There are a few groups of episodes that all start at the same time.
        In the chart, you can tell by the episodes that get stacked on top of
        each other. The most common day and time is
        = succeed "," do
          %em 11:00am on a Tuesday
        with 5 episodes starting at that time, with 3 of them in Season 5 alone.

        This website is a typical Ruby on Rails app. First, I

        then I manually went through every episode on Netflix and set the 'start date'
        of each episode.
        The main chart is built with

        which made the chart-building really easy.
